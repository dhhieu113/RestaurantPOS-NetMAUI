          RestaurantPOS Windows Application
          ================================

          Installation Instructions:
          1. Extract all files to a folder on your Windows machine
          2. Right-click on "install-windows-dependencies.ps1" and select "Run with PowerShell"
          3. Follow the prompts to install the required Windows App Runtime components
          4. After successful installation, run RestaurantPOS.exe

          Note: Windows App Runtime is required for this application to run properly.
          The installation script will help you install this dependency automatically.

          Common Issues:
          - If the application shows a Windows error dialog or crashes on startup, ensure Windows App Runtime 1.5
            is properly installed. You can download it directly from Microsoft:
            https://aka.ms/windowsappsdk/1.5/1.5.240802000/windowsappruntimeinstall-x64.exe
            
          - The application requires Windows 10 version 1809 (build 17763) or later
          
          - Make sure all Windows updates are installed, especially those related to .NET Runtime and
            Visual C++ Redistributable packages

            **Commit:** ${{ github.sha }}
            
            ### Included Platform:
            - 🪟 **Windows Desktop** - Windows application with dependency installer
            
            ### Installation:
            1. Extract all files from the tar.gz archive
            2. Right-click on "install-windows-dependencies.ps1" and select "Run with PowerShell"
            3. Follow the prompts to install the Windows App Runtime components
            4. After successful installation, run RestaurantPOS.exe
            
            ### Required Dependencies:
            - Windows App Runtime 1.5 (automatically installed by the script)
            - .NET 8.0 Desktop Runtime (if not already installed)
            - Windows 10 version 1809 (build 17763) or later
            
            ### Note About CI Testing:
            The application may show launch failures during CI testing due to limitations in GitHub Actions 
            runners. This is expected behavior and doesn't affect the actual application when installed
            properly on a real Windows machine with the appropriate dependencies.
