          RestaurantPOS Windows Application
          ================================

          Installation Instructions:
          1. Extract all files to a folder on your Windows machine
          2. Run RestaurantPOS.exe directly - no installation required!

          Note: This application is compiled with AOT (Ahead-of-Time) technology and is fully self-contained.
          You don't need to install any additional runtime components.
          
          System Requirements:
          - Windows 10 version 1809 (build 17763) or later
          - No additional dependencies required - everything is included in the package!
          
          Troubleshooting:
          - If the application doesn't start, ensure your Windows version meets the minimum requirements
          - Make sure Windows Defender or other antivirus software isn't blocking the executable
          - Try running the application as administrator for the first launch
            
          - For additional help, refer to the GitHub repository or file an issue if you're experiencing problems

            **Commit:** ${{ github.sha }}
            
            ### Included Platform:
            - 🪟 **Windows Desktop** - Windows application with dependency installer
            
            ### Installation:
            1. Extract all files from the tar.gz archive
            2. Run RestaurantPOS.exe directly - no installation required!
            
            ### System Requirements:
            - Windows 10 version 1809 (build 17763) or later
            - No additional dependencies required - the application is fully self-contained with AOT compilation!
            
            ### Note About CI Testing:
            The application may show launch failures during CI testing due to limitations in GitHub Actions 
            runners. This is expected behavior and doesn't affect the actual application when installed
            properly on a real Windows machine with the appropriate dependencies.
